WebGL Teapot
--------------------------

It's the Utah teapot, stretched back to about its original height. With textures, shadows, bump maps and all the awesomeness. 

Javascript code, in rough order of importance
- main.js : the entry point of the code. Glues every part together
- teapot.js : code for drawing teapot and maintaining its states
- streetview.js : code for drawing the panorama and maintaining its states
- pipeline.js : implementation of the perspective - modelview matrix pipeline, plus other boilerplates
- objparser.js : parser for wavefront .obj files
- utils.js : simple library functions

Shaders
